# Tetris-Swap
<i>Tetris with a twist</i><br>
HTML5/Phaser
<br><br>
<b>Current status:</b> almost there. rotation not implemented yet. Some bugs here and there.
<br><br>
Tetris Swap is part of a 3-week assignment in NM4209 Advanced Game Design. The task is to choose a well-known game mechanic 
(eg. swap, jump, shoot) and alter it such that players' expectation would be undermined. 
<br><br>
My chosen mechanic is 'swap'. And my idea is to change how Tetris is played. Instead of controlling the falling blocks to 
form a complete row, the player would control the boards by swapping them instead.
<br><br>
So far, it's been difficult to form a complete row. But I'll implement the rotation first and see how it goes.
